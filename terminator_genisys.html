		<p>The only good thing (if you want to call it that) about this movie was that Arnold Schwarzenegger returned to play the original Terminator character. However, 3 decades have gone by since the first Terminator movie. So, seeing Arnold looking much older made it even more depressing. It was a cruel reminder that everyone is getting older, and the creation of this story is over 30 years old.</p>
		<p>I can't even bring myself to describe to plot of the movie in my own words. You can click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_Genisys">here</a> to read up on the details. Believe me, you're head will spin. The abuse of the time-traveling concept clearly goes too far. And, who knows how far this storyline is going to go.</p>
