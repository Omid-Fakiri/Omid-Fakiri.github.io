			<li>The machines must have somehow realized that the Terminator who was sent to the present-day to kill Sarah Connor failed. So, they decide that the best course of action is to send another terminator to the present-day in order to kill John Connor when he is in his early teens. This time, they send a more advanced prototype called, the "T-1000". This machine is made of liquid metal, and can perform more difficult tasks the original terminator can't.</li>
			<li>In the future, John manages to reprogram the Terminator who was initally sent to kill Sarah in the first movie. And then, he sends it to the present-day in order to stop the "T-1000".</li>
			<li>After saving John and Sarah from the "T-1000", the Terminator takes Sarah and John to a desert location to hide out. They eventually come up with a plan to destory "Cyberdyne Systems", which is the company that developed "Skynet", which is the artificial intelligence that created these machines in the first place.</li>
			<li>The Terminator, John, and Sarah are successful in destroying "Cyberdyne Systems", and killing the "T-1000". The Terminator also concludes that it must be destroyed, so that no one can replicate it. That way, there would be no chance of the machines ever taking over the world. So, Sarah ends up destroying it, and the sequel comes to an end.</li>
			<li>This was definitely a creative and tragic story. However, in my mind, the people in Hollywood just had to become greedy. And, somehow extend what should have been a very well concluded story line.</li>
