			<li>This movie sets the scene for the series...you would think. The machines take over the world in the future. But, a man named John Connor leads the resistance to defeat the machines. This is the part you don't see in the film.</li>
			<li>The machines come up with a plan to defeat John Connor by sending one of them through time to the present-day, in order to kill Sarah Connor, the mother of John before he is born. The only described part you do see is the terminator making it's way to the present.</li>
			<li>In order to prevent the machines from succeeding, John Connor sends one of his soldiers, Kyle Reese to the present to stop the Terminator from killing his mother.</li>
			<li>Kyle saves Sarah from the Terminator when it found Sarah hiding in the nightclub "Tech Noir". Kyle then explains the crazy scenario to Sarah. At first, she thought Kyle was crazy. But, the consistent persistence by the Terminator got her to realize how truthful Kyle was.</li>
			<li>Kyle and Sarah fall in love, make love, then resume hiding, and eventually, fighting the Terminator</li>
			<li>They are successful in terminating the Terminator.  However, the Terminator managed to kill Kyle Reese before Sarah killed it. One would think that the story ends, but it doesn't.</li>
